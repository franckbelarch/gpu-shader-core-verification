- [Project Report](project_report.md): Overview of the project and its achievements

## Results

The `results/` directory contains detailed analysis of verification results:

- [Results Analysis](results/results_analysis.md): Comprehensive analysis of coverage and tests
- [Case Study](results/case_study.md): Case study demonstrating the benefits of AI-assisted verification

## Diagrams

The `figures/` directory contains architecture and verification diagrams:

- `gpu_shader_core.drawio`: GPU shader core architecture diagram
- `verification_architecture.drawio`: Verification environment architecture
- `test_coverage_trends.drawio`: Coverage trends and analysis visualizations

## Getting Started

To get started with the verification environment:

1. Review the architecture document to understand the GPU shader core
2. Follow the user guide for setup and basic usage
3. Explore the example test cases in the `examples/` directory
4. Run the verification and analyze results as described in the user guide
