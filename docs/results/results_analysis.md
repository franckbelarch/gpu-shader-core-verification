## Insights and Lessons Learned

### Verification Effectiveness Findings

1. **ML Model Selection**: Random Forest classifiers provided the best balance of accuracy and training speed for coverage prediction
2. **Feature Engineering**: Test characteristics most predictive of coverage included:
   - Instruction mix diversity
   - Memory access patterns
   - Control flow complexity
   - Data value distributions
3. **Continuous Learning**: Model accuracy improved by 20% when retrained weekly with new test results
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Combined approach outperformed either human-only or AI-only approaches by 30%

### Improvement Opportunities

1. **Coverage Definition Refinement**: Some functional coverage points were too broadly defined
2. **Model Specialization**: Separate models for different component types could improve accuracy
3. **Long-tail Coverage**: Final 5% of coverage took disproportionate effort
4. **Resource Balancing**: Some tests used excessive resources for marginal coverage gain
