# GPU Shader Core Verification Framework

## Overview

This project implements a verification environment for a simplified GPU shader core with specific focus on components relevant to modern GPU architectures. The framework is designed to showcase verification expertise needed for GPU verification roles, particularly for teams working on advanced shader cores with tensor acceleration capabilities.

The project demonstrates verification methodologies for:

1. Core shader processing elements
2. Tensor cores for AI/ML acceleration
3. Memory subsystem verification (including HBM3e)
4. Inference optimization techniques
5. Edge AI capabilities
6. Coverage-driven verification planning
